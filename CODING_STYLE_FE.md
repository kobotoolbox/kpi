Coding Style Guidelines for Frontend
=======================================




Automatic Linting Rules
---------------------------------------

Kobotoolbox uses Biome mainly for formatting, and ESLint exclusively for linting.
- formatting: consistent whitespaces and other style of code
- linting: identifying bugs and anti-patterns

Kobotoolbox has plans to adopt oxlint in the future. It's an upcoming performant competitor to ESlint, but isn't type-aware yet and thus limited in it's capacity.




Manual Linting Rules
---------------------------------------


### Generic

- tag `@deprecated` when deprecating code and explain what to do instead. FYI VSCode nicely strike-through deprecated code.
  - example TS/JSDoc syntax to deprecate external dependencies:
    ```ts
    declare namespace JQuery {
      /** @deprecated use fetch instead */
      export interface jqXHR {
      }
    }
    ```

- don't use `@deprecated` code.


### Naming is hard

- singular for objects (`user`), plural for arrays/maps/etc (`users`), suffix for primitives (`userName`)
- don’t use Systems Hungarian (e.g. `strExample`), because let’s don’t duplicate intellisense. Except for boolean type, because it reads nice, e.g. `isExample`, `hasExample`, etc.
- use [Hungarian Notation](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/05/11/making-wrong-code-look-wrong/) where appropriate (indicate *kind* of the type). Examples: `input` and `inputSanitized` or other way around `inputRaw` and `input`, your choice.
- boilerplate snippets
  - `const exampleQuery = useExampleQuery()` for react query hook usage
  - `import cx from 'classnames';` for classnames import

### Code colocation

Main principle is, keep related code close for modularity. Organize by feature/usage/concept, not type (images at images, etc.). Sanity check question: if requirements would change, what parts of code would likely be changed or deleted together as a bundle?

- organize folders and subfolders by root/global, feature, sub-feature, sub-sub-feature, …. Each level may have generic `common` , `components` and `hooks` folders. Place code as deep as possible to be above or next to all it's consumers. Update as consumers change. Example:
  ```bash
  /
    jsapp/
      common/         # <-- (4) reused non-react-stuff globally go here.
      components/     # <-- (4) reused components globally go here.
      hooks/          # <-- (4) reused hooks globally go here.
      BigFeat/
        common/       # <-- (3) reused non-react-stuff within feature go here.
        components/   # <-- (3) reused components within feature go here.
        hooks/        # <-- (3) reused hooks within sub-feature go here.
        index.tsx
        BigFeatTable/
          common/     # <-- (2) reused non-react-stuff within component goes here.
          components/ # <-- (2) reused components within component goes here.
          hooks/      # <-- (2) reused hooks within component goes here.
          index.tsx   # <-- (1) small helpers or interfaces are co-located inside
                      #         component or hook files, and are not exported.
          useAsdf.ts  # <-- (1) files specific only to other file(s)
                      #         in the same folder stay next to them.
  ```
- organize files by concerns and name it by that. Keep one concern per file. Don't shy away from small but focused files.
     -   one React component per file and name it the same — `Asdf.tsx` or `Asdf/index.tsx`
     -   one React hook per file and name it the same — `useAsdf.tsx` or `useAsdf/index.tsx`
     -   for anything big and/or complex enough, have a seperate file and name it the same
     -   it's ok to co-locate in the same file several similar variations of the same, as well accompanying constants, helpers, type-guards and other utils.
- every folder has a meaningful `index.tsx` files, except `common`, `components`, and `hooks` folders. Index file contains and/or re-exports what consumers outside of folder imports (kinda as folder's API).
- Include type of file in filename only for tests and storybook. Such as:
    - `{index,Foo}.tsx`
    - `{index,Foo}.stories.tsx`
    - `{index,Foo}.{spec,test}.tsx`
    - `useFoo.tsx?`
    - `useFoo.{spec,test}.tsx`


### React specific

- use Typescript, don’t use Javascript
- use React functional components and hooks instead of classes and HOCs
- for response caching use `react-query`, don’t reinvent cache using state
