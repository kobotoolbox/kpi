## Implement the OpenRosa Form Submission API

⚠️This endpoint is only available from the Kobocat domains (ex: kc.kobotoolbox.org or kc-eu.kobotoolbox.org)⚠️

These endpoints are used for adding submissions, depending on the authenticated status of the user.

Adding a submission as an anonymous user: `/{username}/submission`

Adding a submission as an authenticated user: `/submission`
