## Implement part of the OpenRosa Form List API

These endpoints are used for adding submissions, depending on the authenticated status of the user.

Adding a submission as an anonymous user:
`/{username}/formList`

Adding a submission as an authenticated user:
`/formList`


⚠️This endpoint is **only available** from the Kobocat domains (ex: kc.kobotoolbox.org or kc-eu.kobotoolbox.org)⚠️
