    these are the fields added to exports, displayed in the table view, etc.

    multiple actions could result in only a single field, such as a manual

    Returns a list of fields contributed by all enabled actions (at the asset
    level) to outputted submission data as shown in exports, the table view UI,
    etc.

    Consider transcribing `group_name/question_name` into French, both manually

    field for the French transcript:
