    Changes in XLSForm/pyxform#718 prevent

    `bytes | BytesIO | IOBase` are now accepted for treatment as file-like
    objects, and furthermore, anything that is not already a `BytesIO` will
    have its contents placed inside a newly instantiated one.

    Problem: `BytesIO`s do not have `name`s, and the constructor for
    `pyxform.xls2json.SurveyReader` fails because of that.

    Workaround: a `BytesIO` with a `name` ðŸ™ƒ
