## Create an export setting for an asset

<sup>*</sup> _Required permissions: `manage_asset` (Manage project)_

Where:

* `name` (required) is the name of the export setting displayed in the UI
* `export_settings` (required) is a map of defined settings containing the following valid options:
    * `fields` (optional) is an array of column names to be included in the export (including their group hierarchy). Valid inputs include:
        * An array containing any string value that matches the XML column name
        * An empty array which will result in all columns being included
        * If `fields` is not included in the `export_settings`, all columns will be included in the export
* `flatten` (optional) is a boolean value and only relevant when exporting to `geojson` format.
* `fields_from_all_versions` (required) is a boolean to specify whether fields from all form versions will be included in the export.
* `group_sep` (required) is a value used to separate the names in a hierarchy of groups. Valid inputs include:
    * Non-empty value
* `hierarchy_in_labels` (required) is a boolean to specify whether the group hierarchy will be displayed in labels
* `multiple_select` (required) is a value to specify the display of multiple-select-type responses. Valid inputs include:
    * `both`,
    * `summary`, or
    * `details`
* `type` (required) specifies the export format. Valid export formats include:
    * `csv`,
    * `geojson`,
    * `spss_labels`, or
    * `xls`
* `xls_types_as_text` (optional) is a boolean value that defaults to `false` and only affects `xls` export types.
* `include_media_url` (optional) is a boolean value that defaults to `false` and only affects `xls` and `csv` export types.
* `submission_ids` (optional) is an array of submission ids that will filter exported submissions to only the specified array of ids. Valid inputs include:
    * An array containing integer values
    * An empty array (no filtering)
* `query` (optional) is a JSON object containing a Mongo filter query for filtering exported submissions. Valid inputs include:
    * A JSON object containing a valid Mongo query
    * An empty JSON object (no filtering)

**Note that the following behaviour can be expected when specifying a value for the `multiple_select` field:**

* `summary`: Includes one column per question, with all selected choices separated by spaces;
* `details`: Expands each multiple-select question to one column per choice, with each of those columns having a binary 1 or 0 to indicate whether that choice was chosen;
* `both`: Includes the format of `summary` _and_ `details` in the export
