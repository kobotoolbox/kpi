 ### Reports of an user's asset

Returns the submission data for all deployments of a survey.
This data is grouped by answers, and does not show the data for individual submissions.
The endpoint will return a <b>404 NOT FOUND</b> error if the asset is not deployed and will only return the data for the most recently deployed version.
