## Get submission url of enketo in preview mode

Note: Some variation of this url exists:

`/api/v2/assets/{uid_asset}/data/{id}/enketo/view/`: return the url of the enketo submission (as seen in the response example).

`/api/v2/assets/{uid_asset}/data/{id}/enketo/redirect/view/`: redirect to the enketo url submission with a 302 code.
