        #     terminates at the end of the header section). The server SHOULD

        #     would have sent if the request had been a GET, except that the
        #     payload header fields (Section 3.3) MAY be omitted.

        # returned in response to a GET? Currently, it returns
        # `Content-Length: 0` due to Django's `CommonMiddleware`
