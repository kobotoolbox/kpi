        - @*QA* & @*product*: the release window is 4 weeks to make a release, otherwise the branch is scrapped and we start over with next release.
        - @_**Kalvis Kalniņš**: check Linear cycles whether now-past cycle `v${{ needs.version.outputs.current_minor }}` closed today and the upcoming cycle has started.
        - @*devs*: if you merge a PR or cherry-pick a commit into `${{ needs.version.outputs.current_branch }}` branch, then please manually set issue's cycle to the `v${{ needs.version.outputs.current_minor }}` cycle (Linear automatically sets for next one).
