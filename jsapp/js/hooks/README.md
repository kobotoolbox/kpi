# #/hooks

A folder for [custom React hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) that are re-used between multiple features.

By convention, React hooks are prefixed with `use` - like `useEffect`, `useState`, or `useTransition`. Please follow a format of `useSomething.hook.ts` when adding new hooks.
