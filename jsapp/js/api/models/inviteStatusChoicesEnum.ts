 * KoboToolbox Primary API
 * This page documents all KoboToolbox API endpoints, except for those implementing the OpenRosa protocol, which are [documented separately](/api/openrosa/docs/).

The endpoints are grouped by area of intended use. Each category contains related endpoints, with detailed documentation on usage and configuration. Use this as a reference to quickly find the right endpoint for managing projects, forms, data, permissions, integrations, logs, and organizational resources.

**General note**: All projects (whether deployed or draft), as well as all library content (questions, blocks, templates, and collections) in the user-facing application are represented in the API as "assets".
