## What's changed


<details><summary>Bug Fixes (1)</summary>

- **exports**: only try to clean up deployed versions ([#6339](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6339))
</details>

<details><summary>Performance (3)</summary>

- **storageCounters**: use user profile counters instead of aggregated project counters ([#6344](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6344))
    > <!-- ðŸ“£ Summary -->
    > Improve performance by reading storage usage directly from user profile
    > counters instead of aggregating data across projects.
    > 
    > <!-- ðŸ“– Description -->
    > This change replaces the previous approach of calculating storage usage
    > by aggregating all related project counters with a faster, direct lookup
    > from user profile counters. Since the profile already maintains
    > accurate, up-to-date storage metrics, this avoids redundant aggregation
    > queries and reduces database load.

- **submissions**: consolidate storage and submission counter updates for project and user profile ([#6341](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6341))
    > <!-- ðŸ“£ Summary -->
    > Merge updates of storage and submission counters for both projects and
    > user profiles into a single operation each

- **submissions**: use same connection for the transaction and advisory lock ([#6343](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6343))
    > <!-- ðŸ“£ Summary -->
    > Improves database consistency by ensuring advisory locks are created
    > within the same database connection used for the corresponding
    > transaction.
    > 
    > <!-- ðŸ“– Description -->
    > Previously, advisory locks (pg_try_advisory_lock) were acquired through
    > the default KPI database connection even when the surrounding
    > transaction was executed on the KoboCAT database. Although PostgreSQL
    > advisory locks are cluster-wide, this could cause unexpected behavior if
    > the two databases reside on different servers or if the connection
    > lifetimes diverge.
