<details><summary>Features (1)</summary>

- **projectOwnership**: store all transfer errors ([#6268](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6268))
    > <!-- ðŸ“£ Summary -->
    > Retain all errors from transferring a project, displaying up to 100 in
    > Django admin.
    > 
    > <!-- ðŸ“– Description -->
    > When transferring a project, there may be any number of errors that
    > occur when handling individual files. Store individual errors for
    > individual files instead of just the broad 'Some attachments could not
    > be transferred' for easier debugging. These individual errors will be
    > displayed in Django admin.
    > 
    > ### ðŸ‘· Description for instance maintainers
    > Adds a trivial migration (new table). Table may become very large if
    > there are lots of transfers with lots of errors.

- **formbuilder**: groups don't move after creation ([#6270](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6270))
    > <!-- ðŸ“£ Summary -->
    > Fixes a regression where if a group is created in the formbuilder then
    > it will be displayed at the top of the form. Groups are now created in
    > the location of the top-most selected question.

    > New owners now automatically gain full access to all submission data on

    > <!-- ðŸ“£ Summary -->
