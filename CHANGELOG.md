## What's changed


<details><summary>Bug Fixes (6)</summary>

- **assets**: add index on pending_delete ([#6606](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6606))
    > <!-- 📣 Summary -->
    > Improve performance of asset endpoint `/api/v2/assets/` 
    > 
    > <!-- 📖 Description -->
    > This change adds a new database index on the `pending_delete` field used
    > by asset queries. Filtering on this flag is common in list and
    > maintenance operations, and the lack of an index caused unnecessary
    > full-table scans on large datasets. The new index significantly improves
    > query performance without altering application behavior or data
    > semantics.

- **migrations**: rename long-running migration job ([#6627](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6627))
    > <!-- 📣 Summary -->
    > Rename long-running migration job for consistency

- **organizations**: remove duplicate organizations ([#6610](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6610))
    > <!-- 📣 Summary -->
    > A user should only be a member of a single organization. This PR removes
    > any duplicate organizations associated with a user.
    > 
    > <!-- 📖 Description -->
    > Certain accounts were inadvertently associated with multiple
    > organizations due to historical system behavior. This led to confusion
    > around ownership, permissions, and subscription management.
    > 
    > This PR introduces a long-running migration that ensures each user
    > remains part of exactly one organization going forward. When multiple
    > organizations are found for a user, the system keeps the most
    > appropriate one based on the following rules:
    > 
    > - Prefer multi-member organizations (MMO)
    > - If none are MMO, prefer the one with an active subscription
    > - Otherwise, keep the newest organization (based on creation date)
    > - Where safe, unused organizations are removed. 
    > 
    > In addition, this migration addresses two consistency issues that were
    > observed during cleanup:
    > 
    > 1. Any projects that were still owned by the user (instead of the
    > organization) are now transferred to the owner of the kept organization,
    > aligning with the expected ownership model.
    > 
    > 2. Organizations that are effectively multi-member but were not marked
    > as MMO will now have their `mmo_override` flag updated for consistency
    > to avoid future ambiguity in membership and billing flows.
    > 
    > After this migration completes, each user will belong to exactly one
    > organization, shared organizations remain intact, and project ownership
    > and MMO status are consistent with current system behavior.

- **storage**: periodically resync out-of-sync storage counters ([#6605](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6605))
    > <!-- 📣 Summary -->
    > Automatically resynchronize storage counters on a schedule to correct
    > drift.
    > 
    > <!-- 📖 Description -->
    > This PR adds two new tasks to the Celery scheduler to automatically
    > detect and resynchronize storage counters that may become out of sync
    > over time. These maintenance tasks were previously run manually and are
    > now executed on a schedule, ensuring storage usage data stays accurate
    > without requiring manual intervention.

- **userReports**: show correct role for members of multiple orgs ([#6613](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6613))
    > <!-- 📣 Summary -->
    > Correct the `/api/v2/user-reports` endpoint to accurately reflect the
    > user’s role for each organization they are part of.

- **userReports**: rename `/api/v2/user-reports/` API fields ([#6630](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6630))
    > <!-- 📖 Description -->
    > This PR updates the `UserReports` materialized view to rename two fields
    > and add retention context. These changes ensure the API response field
    > names accurately reflect the underlying data and logic.
