## What's changed


<details><summary>Features (1)</summary>

- **exports**: add celery task to delete old anonymous exports ([#6509](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6509))
    > <!-- 📣 Summary -->
    > Automatically removes old anonymous exports to prevent outdated files
    > from being accessible and to keep storage usage under control.
    > 
    > <!-- 📖 Description -->
    > Anonymous exports are now cleaned up automatically after they expire. A
    > new recurring background task deletes export files and their
    > corresponding records once they are older than the value defined in
    > `ANON_EXPORTS_CLEANUP_AGE` (configured in Constance, default: 30
    > minutes).
    > 
    > To ensure system stability, the cleanup runs in small batches of 50
    > exports per execution and uses a distributed lock to prevent multiple
    > workers from deleting the same exports simultaneously. This keeps
    > storage usage under control and prevents outdated anonymous export files
    > from remaining accessible.
    > 
    > Authenticated exports and other project data are not affected.

<details><summary>Bug Fixes (2)</summary>

- **exports**: block access to old exports when permissions change ([#6507](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6507))
    > <!-- 📣 Summary -->
    > Ensure anonymous users cannot access old export files if permission to
    > view submissions is revoked.

- **formLanding**: clone form version button ([#6459](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6459))
    > <!-- 📣 Summary -->
    > 
    > Fixes unresponsive "Clone this version as a new project" button from
    > Project → Form tab.

<details><summary>Performance (1)</summary>

- **userReports**: remove `count` from API response ([#6505](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6505))
    > <!-- 📣 Summary -->
    > Improve user report performance by removing the expensive count
    > calculation from the response.
    > 
    > <!-- 📖 Description -->
    > This change removes the `count` field from the user report API response
    > because calculating the total number of documents is a major bottleneck
    > on large datasets. The count query requires scanning the entire
    > collection, significantly slowing down the endpoint. Clients still
    > receive the paginated results as before, just without the heavy count
    > operation.
