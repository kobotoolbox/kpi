    > <!-- 📣 Summary -->
    > Fixed an issue where subscriptions were not displaying in user reports
    > if the Stripe subscription metadata was missing or incomplete.
    > 
    > <!-- 📖 Description -->
    > Previously, the user reports relied on a specific metadata field
    > (`organization_id`) within the Stripe subscription object to link it to
    > an organization. This caused valid subscriptions created without this
    > metadata such as those created manually via the Stripe Dashboard to be
    > hidden from reports.
    > 
    > This update changes the SQL join logic in the materialized view to use
    > the native relationship between the Stripe Customer and the Organization
    > (`subscriber_id`). This ensures all valid subscriptions are correctly
    > identified and displayed, regardless of whether the `organization_id`
    > metadata tag is present on the subscription object.
