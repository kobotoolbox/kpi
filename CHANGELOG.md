- **migration**: prevent OOM crashes and race conditions in long running migrations ([#6720](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6720))
- **organizations**: add long-running migration to remove organizations owned by deleted users ([#6751](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kpi/pull/6751))
    > <!-- 📣 Summary -->
    > Added a long-running migration task to remove empty organizations that
    > were left behind by permanently deleted users.
    > 
    > <!-- 📖 Description -->
    > Previously, an issue caused empty organizations to remain in the system
    > after an account was permanently deleted. Following the resolution of
    > that issue, a background cleanup process has been introduced to safely
    > remove those older, orphaned organizations. This process ensures that
    > only organizations with no active members are deleted, keeping the
    > system clean and running efficiently.
